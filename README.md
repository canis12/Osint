# Osint
Any osint tools I'd of developed. As I've become better at it I've come to the conclusion I will be able to make my own for specific requirements

on a side note. 
obviously for educational purposes one is not responsible for any damage or stuff you do if one decides to use them. 

my code is clunky , ugly and possibly got a few bugs in.
